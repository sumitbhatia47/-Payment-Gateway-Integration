#Task1: Payment Gateway Integration:

#Objective:


◇ Create a simple website where the payment gateway is integrated.
◇ There will be a simple donate button on the homepage. On clicking
the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where
the user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g.
credit card, Paypal, etc.
◇ Once the payment is done an invoice will be generated and
an email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The
invoice will contain the amount.
◇ On any page/email, only basic information is needed.
◇ Create your own temporary / sandbox/testing accounts with 3rd
party for integrations.
